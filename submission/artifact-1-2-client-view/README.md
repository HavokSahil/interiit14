# Transition Management System — Repository Overview

This repository contains the full implementation, design artifacts, and operational logs for an IEEE 802.11v-based Transition Management (TM) engine with QoE-driven steering logic. The system integrates data collection, neighbor ranking, QoE evaluation, and BSS Transition Request generation within a modular Python codebase.

## System Summary

The Transition Management Engine implements:

- QoE-driven decision logic  
- Neighbor Ranking Pipeline  
- 802.11v BSS Transition Management  
- Pluggable data stores  
- Production-grade observability  

## Documentation

Documentation in `design-docs/` includes architecture and autogenerated reference docs.
NOTE: The API is defined in the `design-docs/architecture-design.pdf`

## Running

```
cd Codes
./run.sh
```

Or:

```
python3 runner.py
```

## Testing

```
cd Codes
python3 run_tests.py
```

## Pilot Deployment

Pilot logs in `pilot-site-logs/` help validate TM logic and roaming behaviour.

## Status

Post-roam QoE delta analysis is not yet integrated and will be added in future revisions.
