# 🤖 Bayesian Optimization for MAB Simulation Log

This document explains the structure and content of the log file generated by the hyperparameter tuning script.

## 1. Project Overview

This log file is the output of a script that uses **Bayesian Optimization** to find the optimal hyperparameters for a **Clustering-based Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB)** system.

The core process for each iteration is:

1.  **Bayesian Optimizer:** Suggests a set of hyperparameters (weights for a reward function and a `K_clusters` value).
2.  **Offline Pipeline:** Runs *using* these parameters. It loads raw data, processes it, and then builds a clustering model (K-Means) and a `utility_matrix`. These are saved as "model artifacts."
3.  **Online Simulation:** Loads the new model artifacts and runs a full simulation (e.g., 899 epochs) to test how well this model performs in a live (mock) environment.
4.  **Result:** The simulation returns a final score, which is fed back to the Bayesian Optimizer. The optimizer uses this score to decide what parameters to try in the next iteration.

The goal is to find the hyperparameters that produce the **lowest** `Score to minimize`.

## 2. Log File Structure

The log file contains multiple iterations. Each iteration is a complete run of the Offline Pipeline and the Online Simulation. Here is a breakdown of a single iteration.

### 2.1. Iteration Start

Each new attempt by the optimizer begins with:
