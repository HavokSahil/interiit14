# Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0 — Development Project

This repository contains the code submissions and workflow files from our participation in the **Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0** development track.  
It was created as part of the project work towards problem statements provided for this year’s Tech Meet; the focus was on building and delivering software solutions aligned with the given requirements.

## Overview

As part of the Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0 development team, we worked on building features and solutions to real problem statements provided during the competition. This repository includes:

- Code submissions at different stages (`submission`, `mid-term-submission`)
- Supporting scripts and utilities
- Environment configuration
- Evaluation and testing resources

> **Note**: This project is authored as part of a collaborative team effort for the Inter IIT Tech Meet. The code in this repository reflects our implementation and iteration over the competition period.
