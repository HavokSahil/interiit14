## Problem 5 [x/10]
    **In large enterprise networks, continuously collecting RF spectrum data from multiple access points can create huge telemetry volumes.**
    **Propose an AI-driven compression and feature-extraction strategy that reduces sensing data bandwidth, without losing critical information for interference classification.**
    _In your answer:_
        - Explain which features or transforms (e.g., STFT, wavelets, learned embeddings) would preserve most discriminative information.
        - Discuss whether you’d use a classical ML, autoencoder, or contrastive learning approach, and why.

_Response_

## Problem 6 [x/10]
    **Traditional reinforcement learning often prioritizes performance over safety but in Wi-Fi RRM, unsafe actions (e.g., rapid power or channel changes) can degrade user QoE.**
        - Propose a safe RL framework for this context.
        - Describe how you would formulate the safety constraints.
        - Identify one algorithm (e.g., Constrained Policy Optimization, Reward Constrained DDPG, or Shielded RL) and explain how it ensures safety during exploration.

_Response_

## Problem 7 [x/20]
    **Describe your intuitive design of a reward model for such a system:**
        - What key performance indicators (KPIs) should contribute to the reward?
        - How would you balance throughput, latency, retry rate, and fairness among clients?
        - What penalties or constraints would you include to ensure safe, stable operation?
        - Finally, write a mathematical sketch of your reward model showing how these factors combine.
